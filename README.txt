Currently, only monsters and number of rooms are able to be generated.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Traps, Level, Difficulty, and Treasure Tuners are disabled.
- Specifics are disabled.
- No text shows up in the text box after generating a dungeon.
- "Accept" only accepts the previously accepted dungeon (not 3-5).
- No hallways (still wondering how best to approach it).
- If you accept a map with mostly big rooms, then increase the number of rooms, the program will crash.
